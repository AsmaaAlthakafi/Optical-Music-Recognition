## Introduction
Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is software that essentially teaches the machine to read sheet music. The aim of this project is to develop a sheet music reader which will classify each music note then produce an audio file of the music it read. 

## Data Description 
The dataset will contain images of music sheets. 

## Tools
 - Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation.
 - Keras for deep learning.
